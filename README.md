## January 7, 2023 - January 27, 2023

- Watched all 16 lectures videos of Stanford's CS193p course on Youtube
  - Some Takeaways
    - More inclined to learn with a far less technical thrown at you approach
    - I like to see a couple lines of code and then see them slowly broken down into their components explained in easier terms
    - Sean Allen is a very good teacher as he takes his time with explaining these concepts in his teachable lectures
    - Considering buying his SwiftUI courses on teachable & watching his Youtube videos on SwiftUI
    
## January 28, 2023

- Started reading "Develop in Swift: Explorations" by Apple.
  - A more beginner friendly book but reads nicely and has a ton of definitions for developer concepts and some nice examples to work through on my own time.
  - However, they do not use SwiftUI as the main framework for UI appliance in the apps. They use UIkit so I have been skimming over these sections or dropping them all together as I'm pursuing SwiftUI in the mean time.
  - The Playgrounds app has also been handy in reinforcing the concepts I'm learning while reading this book
  
## January 29 - 31, 2023

- Discovered Apple's Dev tutorials page in the Developor section on the Apple website and have been living here 
  - They have a great series for both Swift and SwiftUI that has a nice preview section with a step by step tutorial for making apps
- Continued reading "Develop in Swift: Explorations"
  - Unit 1 and 2 were very simple, meant for early, early programmers. 
  - I'm curious to read the next installment in this 4 book series 
## February 1 - 2, 2023
- Continuing reading "Develop in Swift: Explorations" and have been narrowing ideas for an application in the near future to work on
  - Stock Watch (real time stock APIs)
  - Ecommerce clone (implement apple pay)
  - Weather app (Real-time weather APIs)
  - Food delivery clone (mapKit)
  - Watch Party App - Have started
- I'll have narrowed this down to 2 I think by the end of this text book

## February 3 - 20, 2023
- While going through some chapters of Apple's Dev textbooks, I have decided to pursue a "learner's" project and create an InstagramClone to reinforce Swift concepts and also explore Firebase, a cloud storage service.
- A shoutout to Ben McMahen's website on using Firebase in Swift, https://benmcmahen.com/authentication-with-swiftui-and-firebase/
  - His blog posts have been incredibly helpful and made the jump to using Firebase that much simpler. 
  
## February 22 - March 5, 2023
- I've taken the past 2 weeks to develop my InstagramClone learner's project.
  - UI design has been relatively simple and all UI measurements and design decisions have been my own. 
  - As for functionality, 
    - Most of the regular functionality of the IG Clone has been simple or learned through online forums
    - Firebase integration has been simple through Ben McMahen's blogs.

## March 6, 2023
- I've been exploring the idea of a personalized app after completing and publishing my IG Clone to my Github.
  - I'll be on the lookout for ideas for this project but in the meantime I'm still reinforcing concepts with my IG Clone project.

## March 12, 2023
- The Instagram Clone is nearly finished and ready for publishing to my Github
  - A few touchups with Firebase implementation
  
## March 26, 2023
- Created a calculator app over the weekend and published it to Github as another small learner's project to help strengthen some core Swift concepts
